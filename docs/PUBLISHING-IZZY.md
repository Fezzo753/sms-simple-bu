# Publishing to IzzyOnDroid

IzzyOnDroid is a third-party F-Droid repository run by Izzy ([@IzzySoft](https://github.com/IzzySoft)). It hosts the GitHub-Releases-signed APK directly (no rebuild on F-Droid's infrastructure), so updates show up in users' F-Droid clients shortly after each GitHub Release. Useful as a distribution channel alongside the Google Play listing, for users who prefer F-Droid clients or want a non-Play update path.

## Prerequisites

- ☑ MIT license at the repo root (`LICENSE`).
- ☑ fastlane metadata at `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/`.
- ☑ At least one signed APK published as a GitHub Release asset.
- ☐ Optional but recommended: 2–4 phone screenshots in `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/` (PNG, ~1080×2400, named `01_home.png`, `02_picker.png`, etc.). The repo has the directory ready — just drop screenshots in.
- ☐ Optional: 512×512 launcher icon at `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/icon.png`. If absent, IzzyOnDroid uses the APK's icon.

## Submission

1. Make sure v0.1.0 (or later) is published as a Release at <https://github.com/Fezzo753/sms-simple-bu/releases> with `SimpleBackup-vX.Y.Z.apk` attached.
2. Open <https://github.com/IzzyOnDroid/repo/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Inclusion&template=APP.yml&title=%5BInclusion%5D+%3CApp+name%3E>
3. Fill in the Inclusion form. Reference values:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| App name | `SimpleBackup` |
| Source code | `https://github.com/Fezzo753/sms-simple-bu` |
| Package name | `com.simplebackup.app` |
| Released APKs | `https://github.com/Fezzo753/sms-simple-bu/releases` |
| License | `MIT` |
| Categories | `Phone & SMS`, `System` |
| Anti-features (be honest) | `NonFreeNet` if any cloud calls (we have none — leave blank), otherwise none |

4. Submit. Izzy or one of the maintainers reviews — usually within a few days. They may ask for tweaks (e.g. screenshots, license clarification).
5. Once accepted, your app appears at `https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.simplebackup.app` and shows up in any F-Droid client that has the IzzyOnDroid repo added.

## After acceptance

Subsequent releases publish automatically: cut a new GitHub Release with the signed APK as `SimpleBackup-vX.Y.Z.apk`, and IzzyOnDroid's bot picks it up within ~24 hours. No further action needed.

If the package name or signing key ever changes, treat it as a new app — Izzy needs to be notified, and existing users will have to uninstall and reinstall.

## Adding the IzzyOnDroid repo on a phone (for users)

1. Install F-Droid client from <https://f-droid.org>.
2. Open F-Droid → Settings → Repositories → `+` → enter `https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo`.
3. Update repos. SimpleBackup will appear under search.
